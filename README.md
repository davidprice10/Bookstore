# LenusHealthTest

## How to run
Everything should be setup to go and loaded into the IDE of your choosing. I did build this in Visual Studio 2022.

## Additional Notes
Due to time constraints, I would've liked to added unit tests and maybe attack this with a TDD approach and aim for high test code coverage.
